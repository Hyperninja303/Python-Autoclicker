# Python-Autoclicker
This autoclicker is made entirely from python. Using Pynput, I added a "click and unclick" loop just for anyone who (for whatever reason) needs it. I will be adding a right-click feature soon, and will also maybe add a "while True:" Loop so that you dont have to start restart the code repeatedly.
