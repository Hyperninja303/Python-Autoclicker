# Python Autoclicker
This autoclicker is made entirely from python.

## How it Works:
By using a fun python package called "pynput", you can take control of the keyboard, mouse and even the mouse position! By looping a "click" and "unclick" function, you can make a small auto clicker, that you can use for video games, automated typing, running tasks and much more!
