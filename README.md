# Python Autoclicker
This autoclicker is made entirely from **python**.

## How it Works:
By using a fun python package called "**pynput**", you can take control of the keyboard, mouse and even the mouse position! You can use Pynput for **video games, automated typing, running tasks** and **much more**! I made this code by running a "click" and "unclick" loop. ***You can expect some new features coming soon.***
